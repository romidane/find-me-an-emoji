## Background
This is an educational project I build in my spare time during my train commutes to work.
The goal was to build a single page application as well as a game using elm.
The single page asspect of the app is achieved through basic navigation of pages
`/`
`/about`
`/404`

The game part is simple memory game which involves finding pairs of emoticons.
The app can be found here

## Running the app in development mode
`elm-app start`

then navigate to 
`http://localhost:3000`


## Todo

- Write tests
- Add a scoring system
- Some tidying up
